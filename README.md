# CSCI4830-Tech-Assignment

This was a very good learning experience for me on a number of levels. For one thing I hadn't in the past used a lot of the tools/dependencies/etc that I ended up needing to make this project work, including AJAX, jQuery, JSON within javascript, and this was my first time using CSS as well.

I ended up getting a lot of help online with out to make a lot of this work properly in terms of the code itself, especially with AJAX communication between java and javascript. I also ended up needing a lot of help with the different error and exception calls. 

Overall I'm very proud of this project, since it looks good and works pretty well. One major note is I still had to use an incognito tab or clear your browser cache whenever I updated it, as otherwise it would stick to using the old version. This would be another good thing to have learned I feel in this class, how to do that automatically upon loading the HTML page.

I spend very literally days of work on this...which was not the original expectation. The transition from Java to Java script for a lot of the actual functionality was a much needed realization, as the first run through of trying to get this to work was hours of wasted effort.
